## What and why?
* React
* Typescript

The position is for a React developer and i was just curious about Typescript and wanted to try it a little bit

## Dependencies
* "date-fns": Relative time
* "react-pose": List animations
* "styled-components": Styles

## WTF why so much things, why so overhead?
Sorry, i wanted to try new things, althought usually less is more, sometimes you need to try more to learn what is less
